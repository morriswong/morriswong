### Hi there, this is Morris ðŸ‘‹

I am usually trying to finding out why the data goes :chart_with_upwards_trend: or :chart_with_downwards_trend: and help people understand it by making :bar_chart: with my :computer:

![Some dashboards!](https://unsplash.com/photos/6EnTPvPPL6I/download?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MzZ8fGRhdGElMjBkYXNoYm9hcmR8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjgwMjUzNjEy&force=true&w=640 "Some dashboards")

Technolgoies that I worked with the most recently:
- **SQL**, Had some [fun](https://medium.com/@tuewithmorris/solving-a-murder-with-sql-ec6cd7faeb79) with it too
- **Python**, and also the [keyboard shortcuts](https://medium.com/@tuewithmorris/google-colab-notebooks-keyboard-shortcuts-aa6a008fb91b) to live by
- **Tableau** or anything equivalent to it , [viz](https://medium.com/@tuewithmorris/visualising-the-world-press-freedom-index-2020-with-tableau-a10790cd90ae) things out is what I like to do too

I actually started out programming at a full stack coding bootcamp, with Javascript we keep jumping [up](http://datjumper.surge.sh/)

If you made it this far, just connect by shoot me a message!
